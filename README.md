# Machine Learning in Golang

A personal project to help me learn more about the magic of machine learning by implementing what I learnt at university and expanding beyond that.

## Implemented so far/working on currently
- Linear Regression - OLS and Gradient descent (batch and minibatch)
- Neural Netowrk - Multilayer Perceptron
- Loading datasets to allow experimentation with different models

## Things I wish to explore in the future
- Logistic Regression
- Kernels
- SVM's
- Clustering
- Baysian Methods
